# Youtube Project
Christopher Han  

## Introduction
In today’s world, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Videos all compete to gain more subscriptions. Besides these three major subscription services, YouTube is a major platform for content creators to freely share their work and gain viewers. However, one may wonder if the web traffic into YouTube decreases as the subscription services get more and more popular. After all, we have only so much time in our days and if we spend several hours per day watching Netflix, surely we are watching less of YouTube. This project is an attempt to answer that question.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to investigate whether the addition of the variable ‘number of subscriptions to a monthly video service’ such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Videos, or Hulu, account for a significantly greater proportion of the variance in the amount of time spent on YouTube per day. The nuisance variables included are age, gender, number of credit hours currently being taken, and the college classification. This project was a final assignment in the class SDS 358 at UT Austin in Spring 2018 and updated in February 2019.
